## Apache Kafka for Event-Driven Spring Boot Microservices
In this video course, you will learn how to use Apache Kafka to build Event-Driven Spring Boot Microservices.

This course is designed for beginners and will start from the basics of Microservices and Apache Kafka.

You will learn: 

- What is Apache Kafka, and how to work with it using Command Line Interface(CLI),

You will learn how to use Kafka CLI to : 

- Start multiple Apache Kafka servers in a cluster,

- Work with Kafka Topics,

- Work with Kafka Producer to produce messages,

- Work with Kafka Consumer to consume messages.

You will learn how to create a basic Spring Boot Microservice that acts as a Kafka Producer. While working with this Microservice you will learn: 

- How to send Kafka messages synchronously,

- How to send Kafka messages asynchronously,

- How to work with Acknowledgements, Retries, Delivery and Request timeouts.

You will also learn how to create Kafka Consumer Spring Boot Microservice. While creating Consumer Microservice you will learn to: 

- Consume messages from Kafka topic,

- Handle and recover from errors,

- Work with Kafka Dead Letter Topic(DLT),

- Configure multiple consumer microservices to work as a group(Consumer Groups).

All from the very beginning, to help you learn how to create Event-Driven Microservices with Apache Kafka and Spring Boot.
